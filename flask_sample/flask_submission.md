<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What can you tell me about docker? Describe the various steps needed to get an app ran inside a docker container in your own words</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Docker is an open platform for developing, delivering, and running applications. You may<br>enable rapid software delivery by separating your apps from the underlying infrastructure by<br>utilizing Docker. Docker's attractiveness is in how well it can synchronize application development<br>processes with infrastructure management procedures. You may significantly reduce the amount of time<br>that passes between developing code and deploying it in a production environment by<br>utilizing Docker's effective methods for shipping, testing, and deploying code.&nbsp;</div><div>Link :https://docs.docker.com/overview/</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> What is Heroku? Why do you feel it was chosen for this class?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Heroku functions as a cloud-based Platform as a Service (PaaS) that relies on<br>containers. Developers utilize Heroku to deploy, oversee, and scale contemporary applications. Our platform<br>boasts elegance, flexibility, and user-friendliness, providing developers with the most straightforward route to<br>launching their apps in the market. I found it interesting to learn Heroku<br>in class.&nbsp;<br></div><br><div><br></div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> What is flask? List a few things you learned about it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Flask is a&nbsp; web application framework written in&nbsp; Python. It falls into the<br>category of microframeworks, which means it doesn&#39;t impose specific tools or libraries.&nbsp;<div>1.&nbsp; Lightweight<br>and Minimalistic: Flask is intentionally minimalistic, allowing developers to build web applications without<br>unnecessary overhead. It provides essential features without imposing rigid structures.</div><div>&nbsp;2.&nbsp; Modular and Extensible:<br>Flask encourages modularity through blueprints, allowing you to organize your application into smaller<br>components. You can easily extend Flask&#39;s functionality by adding community-maintained extensions.&nbsp;</div><div>3.&nbsp; No Built-in<br>Database Abstraction: Unlike some other frameworks, Flask doesn&#39;t include a built-in database abstraction<br>layer. Developers can choose their preferred database libraries.</div><div>&nbsp;4.&nbsp; Jinja2 Templating Engine: Flask uses<br>the&nbsp; Jinja2&nbsp; template engine for rendering dynamic content in HTML templates. Jinja2 provides<br>powerful features like template inheritance and macros. 5.&nbsp; Werkzeug WSGI Toolkit : Flask<br>relies on the&nbsp; Werkzeug&nbsp; WSGI toolkit for handling HTTP requests and responses. Werkzeug<br>provides essential utilities for routing, request handling, and more. 6.&nbsp; Quickstart and Documentation:<br>Flask offers a straightforward quickstart guide to get you up and running quickly.<br>Its documentation covers various aspects, including routing, request handling, templates, and deployment.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> What is the difference between a Dockerfile and a Github Action .yml file?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div><b>Dockerfile :</b></div><div><ul><li>A&nbsp; Dockerfile is primarily used for building Docker images. It defines the<br>steps needed to create a container image, including installing dependencies, setting environment variables,<br>and specifying the application to run.</li><li>It focuses on the construction of the image<br>itself.</li><li>The scope of a Dockerfile is limited to the image creation process. It<br>doesn't handle orchestration or workflow management.</li><li>We can have full control over the Docker<br>image creation process.</li></ul></div><div><b>&nbsp;GitHub Action .yml File :</b></div><div><ul><li>A&nbsp; GitHub Action .yml file describes a&nbsp;<br>workflow that automates tasks within your GitHub repository.</li><li>It can include multiple steps, each<br>with specific actions (such as building, testing, deploying, etc.)</li><li>While it can use Docker<br>containers, it is not limited to them. You can also run other types<br>of actions (e.g., JavaScript-based) in a workflow.</li><li>It provides a broader context, allowing you<br>to coordinate various tasks (e.g., building, testing, deploying) across different containers or environments.</li><li>It<br>allows more flexibility in defining complex workflows, integrating with external services, and responding<br>to events (e.g., pushes, pull requests).</li></ul></div><div><br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(29, 29,<br>29);"></div><br></td></tr>
